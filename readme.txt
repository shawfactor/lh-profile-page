LH Profile Page is a WordPress plugin that enables users to change their user data on the front end of the website

== Description ==

LH Profile Page creates a post or page shortcode: [lh_profile_page_form]. This shortcode along with appropriate attributes and handlers allow logged in users to change their own user data on the front end or if they have the appropriate capabilities also edit others users on the front end. This plugin works with user data, user meta data and also user taxonomies (if enabled via a user taxonomy plugin like LH User Taxonomies).

== Installation ==

Install using WordPress:

1. Log in and go to *Plugins* and click on *Add New*.
2. Search for *LH Profile Page* and hit the *Install Now* link in the results. WordPress will install it.
3. From the Plugin Management page in WordPress, activate the *LH Profile Page* plugin.
4. Once activated the plugin will create a page with the [lh_profile_page_form] embedded in it. But optionally you can go to *Settings*->*LH Profile Page* in the WordPress menu and specify another page.
